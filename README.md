# The-Fashion-Recommender
The Fashion Recommender System uses a combination of TensorFlow and OpenCV to identify and compare similar dresses available online.

This project was inspired by the [When AI Meets the Runway](https://medium.com/@mpadmavathi026/cnn-fashion-recommender-iit-deep-learning-dress-classifier-ai-fashion-recommendation-aec2fec1c436) by M. Padmavathi.
